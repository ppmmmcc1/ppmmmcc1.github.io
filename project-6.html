                            I wanted a portable, dedicated station for running OctoPi so I could manage my 3D printer without tying up my main computer. Inspired by my Raspberry Pi laptop build, I reworked the concept for a single-purpose device optimized for printing control. The design needed to be compact, durable, and organized, keeping everything in one unit that could be moved around the workspace easily.

                            I designed the enclosure to hold the Pi, a display, a camera module, and integrated cooling vents, all while keeping the footprint as small as possible. Cable routing was built directly into the design so everything stayed clean and tangle-free, making it easier to set up and service. The hinge mounts were reinforced so the lid could be opened and closed repeatedly without wearing out. Every mounting point, vent cutout, and cable channel was placed with a focus on reliability and ease of use.

                            The completed enclosure became a mobile printer control hub that streamlined my workflow and kept my setup organized. It showed I can adapt an existing design into a specialized, single-purpose tool that works better for its intended task while keeping build quality high and usability front and center.
