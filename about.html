                        Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been drawn to how things work. I used to take apart my RC cars, Nerf guns, and pretty much anything with moving parts, not to destroy them, but to understand them. That curiosity turned into obsession, and that obsession became direction. I didn’t just want to know how things were built, I wanted to build things better.

                        Growing up between Massachusetts and Brazil gave me a front-row seat to the realities of climate change. In Brazil, I watched intense heatwaves and floods affect people I cared about. In Massachusetts, I saw systems strain under pressure they weren’t designed for. Those experiences shaped how I see the world and what kind of engineer I want to be, one that builds with purpose. I’m not just here to make machines, I’m here to solve problems that matter.

                        I take that mindset into everything I create. Whether it's designing a low-maintenance filament recycler, building compact laptops from Raspberry Pi boards, or automating nutrient systems for hydroponics, my goal is always the same: make solutions that are efficient, accessible, and good for the planet. I love combining hardware with code, and I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty solving real world challenges.

                        Right now, I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow as an engineer while making an impact. I’m hungry to work with people who care about what they’re building, because every skill I learn on the job is fuel for the startups I’ll launch in the future. I’m not just trying to get hired, I’m here to help build something great, and then pass that energy forward.
