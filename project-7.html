                            On a bike every second matters, sometimes less than a second. This helmet concept is about making those seconds count by turning passive protection into active prevention. It would integrate AI powered hazard detection, predictive alerts, and a heads up display directly into the rider's view.

                            Using a network of small cameras and sensors it could track blind spots, monitor following distance, and highlight road hazards before they become a problem. The AI would learn your riding patterns and local road conditions, getting better at predicting dangerous situations the more you ride. All critical alerts would appear as subtle visual overlays that don't distract from the road.
