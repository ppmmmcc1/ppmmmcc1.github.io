                            This project began as part of a SolidWorks class, but I treated it like a real-world product from day one. I set out to design and build a fully functional Linux laptop powered by a Raspberry Pi, aiming for something practical, affordable, and portable that didn't feel like a rough prototype. I wanted an enclosure that looked clean, routed cables internally without tangles, and gave full access to every necessary port. This wasn't just about putting parts in a box — it was a complete system designed to work reliably while looking professional.

                            Designing a laptop hinge became one of the toughest problems to solve. It took five different iterations before I found one that could hold the screen at multiple angles without wobble, while still folding smoothly when closed. Inside, I had to position the Pi, battery, and display in a way that prevented cable strain and kept all ports perfectly aligned with the enclosure openings. Around 85% of the CAD modeling was my own work, from the main body and lid geometry to the mounting features and internal cable channels.

                            The final laptop was compact, boot-ready, and felt solid in hand. It proved I could own a project from concept to execution while balancing usability, manufacturability, and aesthetics. Beyond the hardware, it showed that I can combine CAD design, mechanical problem-solving, and hands-on assembly into one cohesive build that works as well in practice as it does on paper.
