                            While working on-site at Dassault Systèmes, I was tasked with recreating a missing ULPower aircraft engine valve cover. This wasn't a "find a replacement" job — buying one wasn't an option. It had to be reverse-engineered from scratch, using only measurements, reference images, and my ability to translate them into an accurate, manufacturable CAD model. This was more than just copying a part. It was about producing a file that could go straight into the prototyping and production pipeline without requiring additional modifications.

                            Capturing the geometry required both precision and creativity. I used calipers to take every measurable dimension I could, then referenced photos to model the subtle curves, embossed lettering, and gasket sealing surfaces in CAD. Because this was for an aircraft engine, I had to account for real-world constraints like vibration, thermal expansion, and material removal during machining. I printed a prototype in PLA+ on my Ender 3 V2 Neo to verify the fit and alignment before handing off the final file for production.

                            The completed model matched the original in form, function, and tolerance requirements, making it ready for manufacturing. This project reinforced my ability to bridge physical measurements and digital modeling, while thinking ahead to how the part will perform in an operational environment. It also showed I can work under constraints and deliver a solution that meets both engineering and production standards.
