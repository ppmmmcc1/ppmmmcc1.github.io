                            I designed this monitor mount to support a 7.1 kg, 31.5-inch Acer monitor while keeping the ports easy to access. The concept started with a simple block that locked the monitor at 90 degrees, but I wanted the ability to swivel it up for convenience. From the start I knew PETG would be strong enough, so the challenge became finding the right balance between strength and efficiency by cutting weight where possible while maintaining a high factor of safety.

                           My first simulation showed that a solid PETG block would easily handle the weight, so I began reducing material in controlled ways. Triangular supports set just three millimeters from the walls carried the load well, and additional cutouts only improved force distribution. To push the design, I ran a study with 100 newtons pushing from the top and another 100 newtons pulling through the hinge pin. The results came back mostly in blue and light green, showing plenty of safety margin, with only a small stress spot on one triangle. Instead of adding more infill, I simplified the geometry and added a triangle cutout behind the hinge hole, which increased strength without extra material.I was also concerned about twisting forces being too much for a single screw, so I added a second one and moved them apart to distribute the load. After several iterations I rethought the hinge placement and found a better position that gave me a cleaner load path. Adding the pin to the assembly and running a final simulation confirmed the design.

                            After eight design iterations and many simulations the mount consistently showed a factor of safety between two and five. Maximum displacement was measured at only 0.3 millimeters for the wall piece and .02 millimiters for the screen mount, well within safe limits. The process reinforced my approach of simplify then lighten: remove unnecessary material, reinforce only where the data shows weakness, and trust the results. The final mount is efficient, reliable, and able to hold my monitor in place with confidence.
